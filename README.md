Scripts for automated sending of answers/votes in certain online surveys or votings.

If the requests cannot be sent correctly, due to CORS protection, then follow those steps:
1) Open cmd / terminal
2) Go to the folder with the executive file of your browser, e.g. chrome.exe
3) Then: chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:\chrome_dev"
4) And open the html file (start the script) in the browser opened this way.
